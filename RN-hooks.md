
### Basic Questions

1. **What is a React hook?**
   - **Answer:** A React hook is a special function that lets you "hook into" React features from function components. Hooks are used to manage state and side effects in functional components.

2. **What are the common built-in hooks provided by React?**
   - **Answer:** The common built-in hooks are `useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext`, `useReducer`, `useCallback`, `useMemo`, and `useRef`.

3. **What does the `useState` hook do?**
   - **Answer:** `useState` allows you to add state to functional components. It returns an array with the current state and a function to update that state.

4. **How do you use the `useState` hook?**
   - **Answer:** You call `useState` inside your functional component and pass the initial state. It returns an array where the first element is the state variable and the second is the setter function.
     ```javascript
     const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
     ```

5. **What is the purpose of the `useEffect` hook?**
   - **Answer:** `useEffect` lets you perform side effects in functional components, such as data fetching, subscriptions, or manually changing the DOM.

6. **How do you use the `useEffect` hook?**
   - **Answer:** You call `useEffect` inside your functional component and pass it a function that contains the side effect logic. You can also specify dependencies that determine when the effect should run.
     ```javascript
     useEffect(() => {
       // Side effect logic here
     }, [dependencies]);
     ```

7. **What is a dependency array in `useEffect`?**
   - **Answer:** The dependency array is the second argument to `useEffect` and specifies which variables the effect depends on. The effect will only re-run when these variables change.

8. **What is the difference between `useEffect` and `componentDidMount`?**
   - **Answer:** `useEffect` can replicate `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount` lifecycle methods based on the dependency array. `componentDidMount` runs only once after the component mounts.

9. **How can you clean up effects in `useEffect`?**
   - **Answer:** You can return a cleanup function from the effect callback. This function will run before the component unmounts or before the effect re-runs.
     ```javascript
     useEffect(() => {
       // Setup code here
       return () => {
         // Cleanup code here
       };
     }, [dependencies]);
     ```

10. **What is the `useContext` hook used for?**
    - **Answer:** `useContext` allows you to access the value of a React context within a functional component.

11. **How do you use the `useContext` hook?**
    - **Answer:** You call `useContext` with the context object created by `React.createContext()`.
      ```javascript
      const value = useContext(MyContext);
      ```

12. **What is the `useReducer` hook and when should you use it?**
    - **Answer:** `useReducer` is an alternative to `useState` for managing complex state logic. It is useful when you have state that depends on previous state or when you have multiple state variables.

13. **How do you use the `useReducer` hook?**
    - **Answer:** You call `useReducer` with a reducer function and an initial state. It returns the current state and a dispatch function.
      ```javascript
      const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);
      ```

14. **What is a reducer function in the context of `useReducer`?**
    - **Answer:** A reducer function is a function that determines how the state changes in response to actions. It takes the current state and an action and returns the new state.

15. **What does the `useCallback` hook do?**
    - **Answer:** `useCallback` returns a memoized version of the callback function that only changes if one of the dependencies has changed.

16. **How do you use the `useCallback` hook?**
    - **Answer:** You call `useCallback` with a callback function and a dependency array. The function will be memoized until the dependencies change.
      ```javascript
      const memoizedCallback = useCallback(() => {
        // callback logic
      }, [dependencies]);
      ```

17. **What is the `useMemo` hook used for?**
    - **Answer:** `useMemo` returns a memoized value that only recalculates when one of the dependencies has changed. It is useful for expensive calculations that should not be repeated unnecessarily.

18. **How do you use the `useMemo` hook?**
    - **Answer:** You call `useMemo` with a function that returns a value and a dependency array. The value will be recalculated only when the dependencies change.
      ```javascript
      const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => computeExpensiveValue(a, b), [a, b]);
      ```

19. **What does the `useRef` hook do?**
    - **Answer:** `useRef` returns a mutable object whose `.current` property is initialized with the passed argument. It can be used to persist values across renders or to access DOM elements.

20. **How do you use the `useRef` hook?**
    - **Answer:** You call `useRef` with an initial value and it returns a ref object. The `.current` property can be used to store a mutable value or reference a DOM element.
      ```javascript
      const myRef = useRef(initialValue);
      ```

### Intermediate Questions

21. **What is the difference between `useCallback` and `useMemo`?**
    - **Answer:** `useCallback` returns a memoized callback function, while `useMemo` returns a memoized value. Both are used to optimize performance by avoiding unnecessary re-renders or recalculations.

22. **Can you use hooks inside class components?**
    - **Answer:** No, hooks can only be used in functional components. Class components use lifecycle methods and other class-based features.

23. **What are custom hooks and how are they created?**
    - **Answer:** Custom hooks are functions that use built-in hooks to encapsulate and reuse stateful logic. They are created by defining a function that uses other hooks and optionally returns values.
      ```javascript
      function useCustomHook() {
        const [state, setState] = useState(initialState);
        // logic here
        return [state, setState];
      }
      ```

24. **How can you share stateful logic between components using hooks?**
    - **Answer:** You can share stateful logic by creating custom hooks that encapsulate the logic and then use these custom hooks in multiple components.

25. **What is the `useImperativeHandle` hook used for?**
    - **Answer:** `useImperativeHandle` customizes the instance value that is exposed when using `ref` with forward refs. It allows you to control the instance values that are accessible to parent components.

26. **How do you use the `useImperativeHandle` hook?**
    - **Answer:** You call `useImperativeHandle` inside a component that uses `React.forwardRef`. You pass the ref and a function that returns the values or methods you want to expose.
      ```javascript
      const MyComponent = forwardRef((props, ref) => {
        useImperativeHandle(ref, () => ({
          customMethod() {
            // method logic
          }
        }));
        return <div>...</div>;
      });
      ```

27. **What is the purpose of the `useLayoutEffect` hook?**
    - **Answer:** `useLayoutEffect` is similar to `useEffect` but it runs synchronously after all DOM mutations. It is useful for reading layout from the DOM and synchronously re-rendering.

28. **How does `useLayoutEffect` differ from `useEffect`?**
    - **Answer:** `useLayoutEffect` runs synchronously after DOM updates, which can prevent visual inconsistencies. `useEffect` runs asynchronously after the paint, which is generally better for operations that don’t affect layout.

29. **Can hooks be used conditionally?**
    - **Answer:** No, hooks must be called unconditionally at the top level of the component. Calling hooks conditionally can lead to unpredictable behavior and break the rules of hooks.

30. **What is the `useDebugValue` hook used for?**
    - **Answer:** `useDebugValue` is used to display a label for custom hooks in React DevTools. It helps in debugging custom hooks by providing custom values to show in the DevTools.

31. **How do you use the `useDebugValue` hook?**
    - **Answer:** You call `useDebugValue` with a value or a function that returns a value to be displayed in the React DevTools.
      ```javascript
      function useCustomHook(value) {
        useDebugValue(value);
        // hook logic here
      }
      ```

32. **What is the `useTransition` hook and when should you use it?**
    - **Answer:** `useTransition` is used to manage concurrent state updates, allowing you to mark some updates as "transitions" to improve responsiveness. It helps in keeping the interface responsive during complex state transitions.

33. **How do you use

 the `useTransition` hook?**
    - **Answer:** You call `useTransition` and get a `startTransition` function and a boolean `isPending` that indicates if the transition is ongoing.
      ```javascript
      const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();
      ```

34. **What is the `useDeferredValue` hook used for?**
    - **Answer:** `useDeferredValue` allows you to defer updating a state until the browser has a chance to update the screen, improving performance for complex state updates by deferring less critical updates.

35. **How do you use the `useDeferredValue` hook?**
    - **Answer:** You call `useDeferredValue` with a value that you want to defer updating. It returns a deferred version of that value.
      ```javascript
      const deferredValue = useDeferredValue(value);
      ```

36. **What is the purpose of the `useSyncExternalStore` hook?**
    - **Answer:** `useSyncExternalStore` is used to subscribe to external stores and manage state synchronization in a way that works with React's concurrent features.

37. **How do you use the `useSyncExternalStore` hook?**
    - **Answer:** You call `useSyncExternalStore` with functions for subscribing to the store and getting the current snapshot of the store's state.
      ```javascript
      const state = useSyncExternalStore(subscribe, getSnapshot);
      ```

38. **What is the `useMutationEffect` hook?**
    - **Answer:** `useMutationEffect` is a legacy hook from React's experimental releases, similar to `useEffect`, but specifically for handling mutations. It has been replaced by `useEffect` in stable releases.

39. **What is the `useMediaQuery` hook?**
    - **Answer:** `useMediaQuery` is a custom hook (not built-in) used to determine if a media query matches the current viewport. It’s useful for responsive designs.

40. **How do you use the `useMediaQuery` hook?**
    - **Answer:** You create a custom hook that uses the `window.matchMedia` API to listen for media query changes.
      ```javascript
      function useMediaQuery(query) {
        const [matches, setMatches] = useState(window.matchMedia(query).matches);
        useEffect(() => {
          const mediaQueryList = window.matchMedia(query);
          const handleChange = (e) => setMatches(e.matches);
          mediaQueryList.addListener(handleChange);
          return () => mediaQueryList.removeListener(handleChange);
        }, [query]);
        return matches;
      }
      ```

### Advanced Questions

41. **What are the rules of hooks in React?**
    - **Answer:** The rules of hooks are:
      - Only call hooks at the top level (not inside loops, conditions, or nested functions).
      - Only call hooks from React function components or custom hooks.

42. **What is a “stale closure” in the context of hooks?**
    - **Answer:** A stale closure occurs when a hook captures a variable from a previous render. This can lead to bugs if the variable changes but the hook still uses the old value.

43. **How can you avoid stale closures when using hooks?**
    - **Answer:** You can avoid stale closures by ensuring that you include all necessary dependencies in the dependency array of hooks like `useEffect` or `useCallback`.

44. **How does React’s Concurrent Mode affect hooks?**
    - **Answer:** Concurrent Mode changes the way hooks are scheduled and executed, allowing React to interrupt and resume rendering. Hooks should be prepared to handle these interruptions by following the rules of hooks.

45. **What are some best practices for using hooks in large applications?**
    - **Answer:** Best practices include:
      - Encapsulating complex logic in custom hooks.
      - Keeping hooks simple and focused on a single responsibility.
      - Using `useEffect` and `useCallback` carefully to manage side effects and performance.

46. **What is the `useLayoutEffect` hook used for?**
    - **Answer:** `useLayoutEffect` runs synchronously after all DOM mutations. It is useful for reading layout from the DOM and synchronously applying changes before the browser repaints.

47. **What are the potential pitfalls of using `useRef`?**
    - **Answer:** Potential pitfalls include:
      - Using `useRef` to store mutable values that should trigger re-renders.
      - Misusing `useRef` to bypass React’s state management and lifecycle.

48. **How can you optimize performance using hooks?**
    - **Answer:** You can optimize performance by using `useMemo` to avoid expensive recalculations, `useCallback` to avoid unnecessary re-renders, and `useReducer` for managing complex state logic.

49. **What is the role of the `useEffect` cleanup function?**
    - **Answer:** The cleanup function in `useEffect` runs before the component unmounts or before the effect re-runs. It is used to clean up side effects such as subscriptions or timers.

50. **How can you synchronize state across multiple components using hooks?**
    - **Answer:** You can synchronize state across components using context with `useContext` or by lifting state up to a common parent component and passing down state and state-updating functions as props.

51. **What are “controlled” vs. “uncontrolled” components in React?**
    - **Answer:** Controlled components have their form data controlled by React state, while uncontrolled components manage their own form data using the DOM (e.g., using refs).

52. **How does `useCallback` improve performance?**
    - **Answer:** `useCallback` memoizes a callback function so that it only changes if its dependencies change, preventing unnecessary re-renders of child components that rely on this callback.

53. **When should you use `useMemo` vs `useCallback`?**
    - **Answer:** Use `useMemo` for expensive calculations that need to be recomputed only when dependencies change. Use `useCallback` for functions that are passed as props to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

54. **How does `useRef` differ from `useState` in terms of rendering?**
    - **Answer:** `useRef` does not trigger a re-render when its value changes, while `useState` triggers a re-render. `useRef` is used for accessing and storing mutable values without causing re-renders.

55. **How can you handle form inputs with hooks?**
    - **Answer:** You can handle form inputs with hooks by using `useState` for form values and `useEffect` to handle side effects related to form state. You can also create custom hooks to manage complex form logic.

56. **What are “side effects” in React and how are they managed with hooks?**
    - **Answer:** Side effects are operations that affect something outside the component, such as fetching data or subscribing to events. They are managed with `useEffect` and its cleanup function.

57. **How does `useEffect` handle asynchronous operations?**
    - **Answer:** You can handle asynchronous operations in `useEffect` by defining an async function inside the effect and calling it. The effect itself cannot be async.
      ```javascript
      useEffect(() => {
        const fetchData = async () => {
          const data = await fetch(...);
          // set state with data
        };
        fetchData();
      }, [dependencies]);
      ```

58. **What is a “callback ref” and how does it differ from a “string ref”?**
    - **Answer:** A callback ref is a function that receives the DOM element as an argument, while a string ref is a legacy approach where you specify the ref as a string. Callback refs are more flexible and preferred.

59. **How do you create a custom hook for managing API calls?**
    - **Answer:** You create a custom hook that uses `useState` for managing the API data and loading state, and `useEffect` for performing the API call.
      ```javascript
      function useFetch(url) {
        const [data, setData] = useState(null);
        const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
        const [error, setError] = useState(null);

        useEffect(() => {
          const fetchData = async () => {
            try {
              const response = await fetch(url);
              const result = await response.json();
              setData(result);
            } catch (error) {
              setError(error);
            } finally {
              setLoading(false);
            }
          };
          fetchData();
        }, [url]);

        return { data, loading, error };
      }
      ```

60. **What is the significance of the dependency array in `useEffect` and `useCallback`?**
    - **Answer:** The dependency array determines when the effect or callback should re-run. For `useEffect`, it specifies when the side effect should execute. For `useCallback`, it controls when the callback should be recreated.

61. **What is the difference between `useEffect` and `useLayoutEffect` in terms of timing?**
    - **Answer:** `useEffect` runs after the DOM has been painted, while `useLayoutEffect` runs synchronously after all DOM mutations but before the browser has painted. `useLayoutEffect` is useful for measuring layout and making immediate updates.

62. **How do you handle errors in `useEffect` hooks?**
    - **Answer:** You can handle errors within `useEffect` by using `try/catch` blocks inside the asynchronous functions you define within the effect.

63. **What is the purpose of the `React.memo` function and how does it work with hooks?**
    - **Answer:** `React

.memo` is a higher-order component that memoizes the rendered output of a component. It prevents unnecessary re-renders when the props haven’t changed. It works with hooks by ensuring that functional components don’t re-render if their inputs remain the same.

64. **How do you implement lazy loading with hooks in React Native?**
    - **Answer:** You can implement lazy loading by using `React.lazy` and `Suspense` for code-splitting. However, React Native does not yet support `React.lazy` and `Suspense` out-of-the-box for lazy-loading components.

65. **How do you manage global state with hooks in React?**
    - **Answer:** You can manage global state using React Context API along with `useContext`. For more complex state management, you might combine `useReducer` with Context API or use third-party libraries like Redux or Zustand.

66. **What is the `useTransition` hook and how does it improve UX?**
    - **Answer:** `useTransition` allows you to mark updates as transitions, helping to keep the UI responsive during complex state updates by prioritizing user interactions over less critical updates.

67. **How do you use hooks for performance optimization in React Native applications?**
    - **Answer:** You can use `useMemo` to memoize expensive calculations, `useCallback` to avoid recreating functions, and `React.memo` to prevent unnecessary re-renders. Additionally, consider optimizing flat lists with `FlatList` and its `keyExtractor`.

68. **How do you use the `useFocusEffect` hook in React Navigation?**
    - **Answer:** `useFocusEffect` is a hook from React Navigation that allows you to run effects when the screen gains or loses focus.
      ```javascript
      import { useFocusEffect } from '@react-navigation/native';
      useFocusEffect(() => {
        // Effect logic here
        return () => {
          // Cleanup logic here
        };
      });
      ```

69. **What is the `useSafeAreaInsets` hook and how is it used in React Native?**
    - **Answer:** `useSafeAreaInsets` is a hook from the `react-native-safe-area-context` library that provides the safe area insets of a device, which helps to ensure that content is not obscured by notches or device edges.

70. **How do you implement custom hooks for form validation in React?**
    - **Answer:** You can create a custom hook that manages form values, handles validation logic, and tracks errors.
      ```javascript
      function useFormValidation(initialValues, validate) {
        const [values, setValues] = useState(initialValues);
        const [errors, setErrors] = useState({});

        const handleChange = (e) => {
          const { name, value } = e.target;
          setValues({ ...values, [name]: value });
          validate({ ...values, [name]: value });
        };

        return {
          values,
          errors,
          handleChange
        };
      }
      ```

71. **What are some common performance pitfalls with React hooks?**
    - **Answer:** Common pitfalls include:
      - Unnecessary re-renders due to improper use of `useCallback` and `useMemo`.
      - Stale closures causing outdated values in effects or callbacks.
      - Overuse of `useEffect` leading to performance issues from excessive side effects.

72. **How does `useCallback` help with passing functions as props?**
    - **Answer:** `useCallback` ensures that the function passed as a prop is memoized and does not change unless its dependencies change, preventing unnecessary re-renders of child components that rely on this function.

73. **How can you handle side effects in custom hooks?**
    - **Answer:** You handle side effects in custom hooks by using `useEffect` within the custom hook. This allows you to encapsulate side effect logic and make it reusable.

74. **How do you use `useCallback` with dependencies that may change frequently?**
    - **Answer:** When using `useCallback`, ensure that the dependencies array accurately reflects all variables that the callback function depends on. If dependencies change frequently, `useCallback` will recreate the function as needed.

75. **How does `useMemo` help with optimizing expensive calculations?**
    - **Answer:** `useMemo` memoizes the result of an expensive calculation and recalculates it only when dependencies change, reducing the need to perform the calculation on every render.

76. **What is the role of `useReducer` in managing complex state logic?**
    - **Answer:** `useReducer` helps manage complex state logic by providing a way to handle state transitions through actions and reducers, making it easier to manage and debug complex state changes.

77. **How do you manage state with `useReducer` when the state structure is deeply nested?**
    - **Answer:** You manage deeply nested state by normalizing the state structure and using nested reducers or action creators to handle specific parts of the state. This approach helps keep reducers manageable.

78. **How can you use `useMemo` to optimize performance in lists?**
    - **Answer:** Use `useMemo` to memoize the list items or the logic for rendering list items, so that they are only recalculated when necessary, improving performance for large lists.

79. **What is the impact of using `useLayoutEffect` for layout calculations?**
    - **Answer:** `useLayoutEffect` allows you to perform layout calculations and DOM mutations synchronously before the browser paints. This ensures that any changes are applied before the user sees the updates, preventing visual inconsistencies.

80. **How does `useTransition` improve the user experience during state updates?**
    - **Answer:** `useTransition` helps by marking state updates as transitions, allowing React to keep the user interface responsive and smooth during complex or lengthy updates, improving overall user experience.

81. **What is the purpose of the `useImperativeHandle` hook and how does it work?**
    - **Answer:** `useImperativeHandle` allows you to customize the instance value that is exposed when using `ref` with forward refs. It is useful for exposing specific methods or properties to parent components.

82. **How do you handle form submission and validation with hooks?**
    - **Answer:** You handle form submission by using `useState` to manage form values and validation errors. You can then use `useEffect` to trigger validation and update error messages as needed.

83. **How can you handle asynchronous data fetching in custom hooks?**
    - **Answer:** Handle asynchronous data fetching in custom hooks by defining an async function within `useEffect`, performing the data fetch, and updating state with the fetched data.

84. **What is the difference between `useRef` and `useState` when managing form inputs?**
    - **Answer:** `useRef` does not trigger re-renders when its value changes, making it suitable for managing form inputs without causing unnecessary updates. `useState` triggers re-renders, which can be useful if you need to reflect input changes in the UI.

85. **How do you manage focus and blur events using hooks?**
    - **Answer:** Manage focus and blur events by using `useRef` to access DOM elements and attaching event listeners in `useEffect` to handle these events.

86. **What is the `useAsync` hook and how is it used for managing asynchronous operations?**
    - **Answer:** `useAsync` is a custom hook for managing asynchronous operations, including tracking loading, error states, and the result. It simplifies handling async logic within components.
      ```javascript
      function useAsync(asyncFunction, dependencies) {
        const [state, setState] = useState({ data: null, loading: true, error: null });

        useEffect(() => {
          asyncFunction()
            .then((data) => setState({ data, loading: false, error: null }))
            .catch((error) => setState({ data: null, loading: false, error }));
        }, dependencies);

        return state;
      }
      ```

87. **How do you handle component unmounting with `useEffect`?**
    - **Answer:** Handle component unmounting by returning a cleanup function from `useEffect`. This function will be called when the component unmounts or before the effect re-runs.

88. **What are the best practices for using hooks with third-party libraries?**
    - **Answer:** Best practices include:
      - Ensuring that hooks follow the rules of hooks.
      - Wrapping third-party hook functionality in custom hooks if needed.
      - Checking the third-party library’s documentation for any specific hook usage guidelines.

89. **How do you handle performance issues caused by frequent re-renders?**
    - **Answer:** Handle performance issues by using `useMemo` and `useCallback` to avoid unnecessary recalculations and function recreations. Also, consider optimizing rendering with `React.memo` and shouldComponentUpdate.

90. **What is the `useErrorBoundary` hook and how does it handle errors in React?**
    - **Answer:** `useErrorBoundary` is not a built-in hook, but a custom hook or library-based solution that provides error boundary functionality for catching and handling errors in React components.

91. **How can you use hooks to manage animation state in React Native?**
    - **Answer:** Manage animation state using `useState` or `useRef` for tracking animation progress. Combine with libraries like `react-native-reanimated` or `Animated` from React Native for handling animations.
