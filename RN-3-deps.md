Here’s a comprehensive set of interview questions and answers about widely used third-party dependencies in React Native. These libraries are popular and commonly used in many React Native projects. 

### 1. **React Navigation**

1. **What is React Navigation, and why is it used?**
   - **Answer:** React Navigation is a popular library for routing and navigation in React Native applications. It provides a way to navigate between different screens or views within an app and manage the navigation stack.

2. **How do you set up React Navigation in a React Native project?**
   - **Answer:** To set up React Navigation, you need to install the core library and the required dependencies:
     ```bash
     npm install @react-navigation/native
     npm install @react-navigation/stack
     npm install react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context
     ```
     Then, wrap your app in the `NavigationContainer` and define your navigators.

3. **Explain the difference between `StackNavigator` and `TabNavigator`.**
   - **Answer:** `StackNavigator` manages a stack of screens, allowing users to navigate to new screens and go back. `TabNavigator` provides tab-based navigation, where each tab represents a different screen or view.

4. **How do you pass parameters between screens using React Navigation?**
   - **Answer:** Parameters can be passed using the `navigation` prop. For example, in a screen component:
     ```javascript
     navigation.navigate('Details', { itemId: 86 });
     ```
     To retrieve parameters in the target screen:
     ```javascript
     const { itemId } = route.params;
     ```

5. **How do you handle deep linking with React Navigation?**
   - **Answer:** Deep linking is configured using the `Linking` module from React Native. You need to configure your navigator to handle URL paths and define how your app should react to specific URLs.

### 2. **Redux**

6. **What is Redux, and how does it fit into a React Native application?**
   - **Answer:** Redux is a state management library that helps manage the application state in a predictable way using actions, reducers, and a central store. It is commonly used in React Native apps to manage complex state and facilitate state sharing across components.

7. **How do you integrate Redux with a React Native application?**
   - **Answer:** Install Redux and React-Redux:
     ```bash
     npm install redux react-redux
     ```
     Create a store, reducers, and provide the store to your app using the `Provider` component.

8. **Explain the role of `mapStateToProps` and `mapDispatchToProps` in Redux.**
   - **Answer:** `mapStateToProps` maps the state from the Redux store to the component’s props. `mapDispatchToProps` maps dispatch actions to the component’s props, allowing components to dispatch actions to update the state.

9. **What is a thunk in Redux, and how is it used?**
   - **Answer:** A thunk is a middleware in Redux that allows action creators to return a function instead of an action object. This function can perform asynchronous operations before dispatching actions. It is used for handling side effects like API calls.

10. **How do you handle asynchronous actions in Redux?**
    - **Answer:** Use middleware like `redux-thunk` or `redux-saga` to manage asynchronous actions. `redux-thunk` allows you to dispatch functions that perform async operations before dispatching actual actions.

### 3. **Axios**

11. **What is Axios, and how is it used in React Native?**
    - **Answer:** Axios is a promise-based HTTP client that is used to make HTTP requests to APIs. It simplifies making requests and handling responses compared to the native `fetch` API.

12. **How do you install and configure Axios in a React Native project?**
    - **Answer:** Install Axios using npm:
      ```bash
      npm install axios
      ```
      Configure Axios with default settings if needed:
      ```javascript
      import axios from 'axios';

      const instance = axios.create({
        baseURL: 'https://api.example.com',
      });
      ```

13. **How do you make a GET request using Axios?**
    - **Answer:** Use the `axios.get` method to make a GET request:
      ```javascript
      axios.get('/endpoint')
        .then(response => console.log(response.data))
        .catch(error => console.error(error));
      ```

14. **How do you handle errors in Axios requests?**
    - **Answer:** Use `.catch()` to handle errors or use `try/catch` with async/await:
      ```javascript
      axios.get('/endpoint')
        .then(response => console.log(response.data))
        .catch(error => console.error(error));
      ```
      ```javascript
      try {
        const response = await axios.get('/endpoint');
        console.log(response.data);
      } catch (error) {
        console.error(error);
      }
      ```

15. **How can you set default headers in Axios for every request?**
    - **Answer:** Use the `defaults` property of Axios to set default headers:
      ```javascript
      axios.defaults.headers.common['Authorization'] = 'Bearer token';
      ```

### 4. **React Native Elements**

      ```javascript
      import { Button } from 'react-native-elements';

      <Button title="Press me" onPress={() => console.log('Pressed')} />
      ```

18. **How do you customize the styling of components in React Native Elements?**
    - **Answer:** You can customize the styling by passing style props directly or using the `containerStyle`, `titleStyle`, and other specific style props provided by the components.

19. **Can you use React Native Elements components with other UI libraries?**
    - **Answer:** Yes, React Native Elements components can be used alongside other UI libraries. However, make sure to manage styling conflicts and ensure consistent design across your app.

20. **How do you handle theme customization in React Native Elements?**
    - **Answer:** Use the `ThemeProvider` component from React Native Elements to customize and apply themes across your app:
    ```javascript
    import { ThemeProvider } from 'react-native-elements';

    const theme = {
      colors: {
        primary: 'blue',
        secondary: 'gray',
      },
    };

    <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
      <App />
    </ThemeProvider>
    ```

### 5. **Formik**

21. **What is Formik, and how does it simplify form handling in React Native?**

        )}
      </Formik>
      ```

23. **How do you handle form validation with Formik?**
    - **Answer:** Use the `validationSchema` prop to integrate with validation libraries like Yup:
      ```javascript
      import * as Yup from 'yup';

      const validationSchema = Yup.object().shape({
        email: Yup.string().email('Invalid email').required('Required'),
        password: Yup.string().min(6, 'Too short').required('Required'),
      });

      <Formik

        onSubmit={values => console.log(values)}
      >
        {/* Formik form goes here */}
      </Formik>
      ```

24. **What are Formik’s `Field` and `Form` components used for?**
    - **Answer:** `Field` is used to bind form inputs to Formik’s state, and `Form` is a wrapper component that handles form submission and validation.

25. **How do you handle dynamic form fields with Formik?**
